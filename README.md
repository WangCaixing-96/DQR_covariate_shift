# Code for "Deep Nonparametric Quantile Regression under Covariate Shift"

Run the simulation for the univariate model in "Univariate_Experiments.ipynb".

Run the simulation for the multivariate model in "Multivariate_Experiments.ipynb".

Run the "plot.ipynb" for the picture of this paper.

The simulation compares the result between unweighted, reweighted and pre-trained estimator for the bounded and unbounded ratio cases.

The yaml file contains the super-parameters used in network and training process.
